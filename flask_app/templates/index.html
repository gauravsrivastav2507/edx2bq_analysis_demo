        <h2>Welcome to edX data analysis</h2>
        <p>This website is based on the edX to BigQuery workflow. You can use this website to view a demo of sample edX data, or analyze your own edX data by signing on to your Google BigQuery account.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>This code/website is not suitable for touchscreen devices, according to our tests.</li>
                <li>This code is <b>NOT</b> production-grade, and not intended to be used directly with the BigQuery data to interpret student learning. We are working on the code. Email <a href="mailto:anindyar@mit.edu">anindyar@mit.edu</a> if you'd like to be notified about the "new and improved" versions.</li>
                    
                <li>The sample dataset shown here is representative but fake.</li>

                <li>An earlier version of this demo (along with other useful jupyter notebooks) is available from <a href="https://github.com/vlampietti/edx_analysis" target="_blank">Vita Lampietti's Github account.</a></li>
                
                <li>A secondary goal of this website is to generate discussions about what learning-analytics quantities are easily available on the edX platform, and how instructors/researchers could use such quantities to improve/study student learning.</li>
